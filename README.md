## Hello, I'm Vincent Punabantu ðŸ‘‹

### About Me
Iâ€™m a PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cape Town. I am currently working in the Centre for Computational and Applied Mechanics (CERECAM) lab. I fix broken hearts for a living. No seriously. More acuratly I help in the process by using physics and computers to simulate cardiovascular disease.
I'm a builder passionate about combining deep learning, physics, and engineering design to solve problems faced by my community (Southern Africa). I love working on projects that mix **Hardware**, **Science**, **Computers**, and **Design**.
